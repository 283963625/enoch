        And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:
        And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
        And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
        And Enoch walked with God: and he [was] not; for God took him.
